1. python3 split_pic.py
   The picture will be splited into small pieces in directory "split" .

2. bash tesseract_test.sh
   The small pictures will be sent to tesseract to do the analyse, and save the result into
   *_output.txt files  in directory "split" .

3. python3 OCR_score.py --img_dirs "['split']" --test_string "0123456789012345678901234567890"
   To calculate the score of each grid of the original picture. The results will be saved in 
   *_output_Score.txt (original_score,norm_score) in directory "split" .  And the scores of all
   grids will be saved to all_scores.txt, the file can be plot the contour picture by gnuplot.

4. python3 OCR_test_plot.py --img_dir split
   To visualize the result and the score of each grid. The result will be saved in test.png 
   (the output file name can be change by --out_file option).

5. gnuplot gnuplot-script.pm3d.plt
   To visualize the result by gnuplot contour plot.
